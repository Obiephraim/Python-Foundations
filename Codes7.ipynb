If the value of the left operand, in this case the variable i, is greater than the value of the right operand, in this case 5, then the statement is True. Otherwise, the statement is False.

    "For example, consider the blue rectangle representing an ACDC concert. If the individual is older than 18, they can enter the ACDC concert. If they are 18 or younger, they cannot enter the concert.\n",

    "We can use the condition statements learned before as the conditions that need to be checked in the if statement. The syntax is as simple as  if condition statement :, which contains a word if, any condition statement, and a colon at the end. Start your tasks which need to be executed under this condition in a new line with an indent. The lines of code after the colon and with an indent will only be executed when the if statement is True. The tasks will end when the line of code does not contain the indent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case below, the code print(“you can enter”) is executed only if the variable age is greater than 18 is a True case because this line of code has the indent. However, the execution of print(“move on”) will not be influenced by the if statement.\n",

    "It is helpful to use the following diagram to illustrate the process. On the left side, we see what happens when the condition is True.

On the right side, we see what happens when the condition is False; the person is not granted access, and the person moves on. In this case, the segment of code in the indent does not run, but the rest of the statements are run.\n",

    "The else statement runs a block of code if none of the conditions are True before this else statement. Let's use the ACDC concert analogy again. If the user is 17 they cannot go to the ACDC concert, but they can go to the Meatloaf concert. The syntax of the else statement is similar as the syntax of the if statement, as else :. Notice that, there is no condition statement for else. Try changing the values of age to see what happens:\n",

    "The elif statement, short for else if, allows us to check additional conditions if the condition statements before it are False. If the condition for the elif statement is True, the alternate expressions will be run. Consider the concert example, where if the individual is 18 they will go to the Pink Floyd concert instead of attending the ACDC or Meat-loaf concert. A person that is 18 years of age enters the area, and as they are not older than 18 they can not see ACDC, but since they are 18 years of age, they attend Pink Floyd. After seeing Pink Floyd, they move on. The syntax of the elif statement is similar in that we merely change the if in the if statement to elif.\n",

If the condition for the elif statement is True, the alternate expressions will be run. Consider the concert example, where if the individual is 18 they will go to the Pink Floyd concert instead of attending the ACDC or Meat-loaf concert. A person that is 18 years of age enters the area, and as they are not older than 18 they can not see ACDC, but since they are 18 years of age, they attend Pink Floyd. After seeing Pink Floyd, they move on. The syntax of the elif statement is similar in that we merely change the if in the if statement to elif."
